# Forge

**Forge** is a developer-first, terminal-based Git-aware project management system.
It integrates version control context with lightweight task tracking in a single TUI workflow, allowing developers to manage code changes, view diffs, and track project progress without leaving the terminal.

Forge loads your current Git repository automatically and presents:

- **Real file changes** from `git status`
- **Live diff previews** for modified files
- **Current branch** and repository metadata
- **Project board** for task tracking (manual module management)
- **Merge conflict visualization** with resolution tracking
- **Configurable themes** and settings

---

## Project Objective

Forge validates the usability of a **Git-integrated project board and change visualization system** through a **Text User Interface (TUI)**.

Core question:

> _Can a developer manage project context, tasks, and code changes from a single terminal interface without breaking their coding flow?_

---

## Current State

### Git Integration ✅

- Automatic repository discovery on startup
- Real-time file status (`git status`)

## Key Screens / Views

### 1. Dashboard

- Project list (left pane, selectable)
- Project metadata display (right pane):
  - Name, branch, module count, developer count, description

- Selection syncs with menu when tabbing between views

### 2. Project Board

- Kanban-style layout with three columns:
  - **Pending** — Modules not yet started
  - **Current** — In-progress modules with assigned developer and progress %
  - **Completed** — Finished modules

- Module cards display:
  - Module name
  - Owner (resolved developer name or "unassigned")
  - Progress percentage (0–100%)

- Note: Modules/developers are manually managed (not yet auto-populated from Git)

### 3. Changes Page

- Left pane: List of changed files **from Git status** with staging indicators:
  - `[✓]` — Staged for commit
  - `[ ]` — Unstaged
  - `[M]` — Modified files
  - `[A]` — New/untracked files
  - `[D]` — Deleted files

- Right pane: **Real diff preview** from `git diff` for selected file
- Bottom pane: Commit message input
- Press `Space` to stage/unstage individual files
- Press `Enter` to commit (only commits staged files)
- Bottom pane: Commit message input
  - Type freely; press Enter to stage all + commit when a Git repo is detected
  - Status bar shows commit confirmation or error details

### 4. Commit History

- Two-pane layout:
  - **Left**: Commit list (hash, first-line message, author, date)
  - **Right**: Commit details (full message + files changed)

- Shows up to the 50 most recent commits

### 5. Branch Manager

- Branch list with current branch highlighted
- Local branches only; creation/switch/delete flows are visible but not yet wired

### 6. Merge Visualizer

- Three-pane layout:
  - **Left**: List of changed files from Git
  - **Center**: Local version diff preview
  - **Right**: Incoming version diff preview

- Navigate between panes with Left/Right arrows
- Accept resolution with Enter (tracks choice with green border highlight)
- Focused pane highlighted in yellow, accepted pane in green

### 7. Settings

- **Theme**: Default / High Contrast (applies to status bar styling)
- **Notifications**: On / Off (placeholder)
- **Autosync**: On / Off (placeholder)
- Toggle with Enter, reflects immediately in UI

### 8. Module Manager

- Split view: Modules on the left, developers on the right
- Reads persisted modules/developers (if present in `.forge`); editing/creation flows are not yet active

## Design Philosophy

- **Git-first mindset** (no abstraction hiding Git concepts)
- **Low cognitive overhead**
- **Keyboard-driven workflow**
- **Developer-centric UI**
- **Explicit > implicit behavior** (no hidden automation)
- **Stateful navigation** — Focus indicates where actions apply

The system assists understanding—it does not make decisions for the developer.

## Navigation Model

### Focus & State

The app tracks **two focus modes**:

1. **Menu Focus**
   - Top-bar menu is active (highlighted in yellow/bold)
   - Tab/Up/Down cycle or navigate menu items
   - Enter selects an item and switches view
   - Status bar shows "Focus: Menu"

2. **View Focus** (default starting state)
   - Content area (current view) is active

- Tab cycles between views (Dashboard → Changes → History → Branches → Merge → Board → Modules → Settings)
- Up/Down navigate within the current view (project list, files, etc.)
- Esc returns focus to menu
- Menu selection auto-syncs to current view when cycling

### Keyboard Bindings

| Key            | Action                                                          |

## Data Source

Forge automatically discovers and loads your **current Git repository** on startup:

- **Repository Discovery**: Uses `git2` to find the nearest `.git` folder
- **Project Creation**: Generates a project from:
  - Repository name (from folder name)
  - Current branch (from HEAD)
  - File changes (from `git status`)
  - Diff previews (from `git diff`)
- **Fallback**: If no repo found, starts with empty project list
- **Persistence**: Module progress saved to `.git/forge/progress.txt`; modules/developers persisted to `.forge/*.json`

**Modules and Developers** are currently **manual placeholders** (not auto-populated from Git history).

## Architecture Notes

### App State (`src/main.rs`)

```rust
pub struct App {
    current_view: AppMode,               // Which view is visible
    focus: Focus,                        // Menu or View
    menu_selected_index: usize,          // Which menu item is highlighted
    store: FakeStore,                    // Project data (Git-backed)
    git_client: Option<GitClient>,       // Git repository handle
    git_workdir: Option<PathBuf>,        // Repo path
    settings: AppSettings,               // Theme/notifications/autosync
    merge_resolutions: HashMap<...>,     // Accepted merge decisions
    status_message: String,              // Bottom bar text
    search_active: bool,                 // Search mode flag
    // ... view-specific state (selections, scrolls, commit msg, etc.)
}
```

### Event Handling

1. `KeyHandler` reads terminal events and maps to `KeyAction` enum
2. `App::handle_action()` updates state based on focus & current view
3. `App::render()` passes state to `Screen`
4. `Screen` routes render calls to the appropriate page component
5. Each page is a **stateless render function** consuming read-only state

### Focus-Based Behavior

- Menu has different keybindings than views
- Tab behavior changes based on focus
- Menu selection index syncs with current view when tabbing in View focus
- Esc returns to menu or exits search/help
